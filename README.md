-This site uses Netlify for its hosting (no longer using Surge.sh as of 9/2022)
-The contact form uses a node mailer function hosted on heroku. This needs to be changed to use Netlify forms since Heroku is removing their free service.
To do:
Convert this repo and site to a Vue SPA.
Convert contact form to Netlify form.
